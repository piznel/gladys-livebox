# gladys-livebox : a [Gladys](https://github.com/GladysProject) module
This module allows you to control the Orange Livebox decoder. It works with Gladys' native "television" box.
It also adds a new box, which allows you to choose the channel on an image mosaic, and manage the basic functions (turn on/off, increase/decrease/mute the sound, change channel) :
